    "### 1.1 Inference Question:\n",
    "How is the likelihood of contracting heart disease impacted by, age, sex, max heart rate, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and chest pain type?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Background\n",
    "For nearly a century, heart disease has claimed the many lives of men and women alike, and men are more likely to get it than women(Fallon, 2019). Besides, as the population ages, an increasing number of people are suffering from heart disease (Kodali et al., 2018). Thus, we believe that the risk of heart disease is related to gender and age and may also be related to other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The Heart Disease Dataset\n",
    "The dataset that we will be using for this project is one related to heart disease and the factors that contribute to it. The link to this dataset is included below, but in this project, we will be reading the data directly from the web, so there is no need to have the file saved locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above link, the Cleveland dataset will be used which contains 76 factors, however, the processed data, contains 14 factors. We will further filter this data to be the 6 factors that we will be examining, which are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Health Factors:\n",
    "- age \n",
    "- sex \n",
    "- pain.type -> type of pain experienced by patient (angina, abnormal angina, not angina, or asymptomatic)\n",
    "- restbps -> resting blood pressure of the patient\n",
    "- cholesterol\n",
    "- maxbpm -> maximum heart rate of the patient\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen these specific factors for our analysis, as these are the factors we think would have the greatest influence on whether or not a patient potentially has heart disease. We also would like to investigate that heart disease would affect women more than men, and thus have included the sex variable, to see if this hypothesis holds true. \n",
    "\n",
    "The factors that were omitted were due to redundancy or their uncertain nature, in terms of measurement units and missing data. One predictor, resting ECG, which measures the electrical activity in the heart was considered, however, we deemed that the resting blood pressure would be a better indicator of heart activity.\n",

    "Through our initial analysis, this dataset suggests that men are more prone to developing heart disease than women, however, this could be affected by the fact that the majority of the patients in this dataset were male, so the samples weren’t the best for this comparison. We also were able to find that there is a correlation between some of the other factors such as the max heart rate and cholesterol, but some factors like chest pain showed that the majority of patients were asymptomatic.\n",

We believe that if the data set contained more data, the model would be able to predict with a higher degree of accuracy. This analysis provides a good basis for creating a model to help people to prevent heart disease at an early stage. It can potentially prevent heart disease from developing entirely if they find, for instance, their resting blood pressure to be in a sort of \"danger\" zone in terms of contracting heart disease. \n",
